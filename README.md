This is a repsonsive and functional event ticketing website completed as a team project for a university web programming module. 

The pages I made: 

 - Index aka Home Page
 - About us
 - Event Management ie adminEvents

*As well as all associated CSS, PHP, files, modals, pop-ups etc related/inlcuded in these pages. 

Both front-end and back-end are fully functional and enter/delete/update the database on phpMyAdmin :)
